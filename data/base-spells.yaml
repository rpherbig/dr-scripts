  dissect: Using your knife as a probe
  consume: a few quick, precise cuts with your ritual knife
  arise: carefully carve a ritual design across a handspan of its body
  construct: Rituals do not work upon constructs
  butcher: Making several deep cuts with your knife

  - A failed or completed ritual has rendered this corpse unusable for your purpose
  - unable to discern where to direct your thanatological expertise
  - You realize the unfortunate butchery ruins the body for any further attempts at rituals
  - A skinned creature is worthless for your purposes
  - The consumption ritual performed on this corpse prevents its harvesting
  - much too battered and beat up to extract any body parts from
