# By default, `skill-recorder` script tracks your effective ranks
# for some skills, such as Athletics, based on a flat 10% increase
# if certain buffs are active. However, you actually may have more (or less)
# depending on how powerful your buff (or curse) is at the time.
# To take advantage of more precise effective ranks, set this to true.
# It will parse `exp mods` command to get your true effective ranks.

# The number of seconds the `drinfomon` script waits

# For Dragonrealms on Lich5 only
# A change in behavior from Lich4 to Lich5 caused certain ;go2 map wayto movements to fail.
# This is because of the way the map stringprocs are structured, and the method used to evaluate
# certain map moves, which involved an arguably dubious overloading of FalseClass on Lich4.
# The transition to Lich5 makes it necessary to fix some stringprocs as an interim solution, at
# least until the map can be divested from current control and handled appropriately. This section
# FIXES via stringproc known map movement failures as a result of the transition to Lich5. A user
# with the appropriate skill can overload these in their own yaml(s).
